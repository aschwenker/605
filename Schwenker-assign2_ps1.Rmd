1. Problem set 1
(1) Show that $A^T$A $\neq$ A$A^T$
```{r}
A<-matrix(c(0,1,0,0),nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
A
At<-t(A)
AtA<-At%*%A
AAt<-A%*%At
AtA
AAt
identical(AtA, AAt) 
```

in general. (Proof and demonstration.)
(2) For a special type of square matrix A, we get $A^T$A = A$A^T$
Under what conditions could this be true? (Hint: The Identity matrix I is an example of such a matrix).

If the matrix is symmetical, its transpose will be identical, thus $A^T$A = A$A^T$

```{r}
A<-matrix(c(3,0,0,3),nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
A
At<-t(A)
AtA<-At%*%A
AAt<-A%*%At
AtA
AAt
identical(AtA, AAt)
```
