Using the “cars” dataset in R, build a linear model for stopping distance as a function of speed and replicate the analysis of your textbook chapter 3 (visualization, quality evaluation of the model, and
residual analysis.)

```{r}
summary (cars)
```

VISUALIZATION
```{r}
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist, xlab='Speed - miles per hour', ylab='Stopping Distance - feet', 
     main='Stopping Distance as a function of Speed')
```
```{r}
stop_by_speed<- lm(cars$dist ~ cars$speed)
stop_by_speed

plot(cars$speed,cars$dist)
abline(stop_by_speed)
```


QUALITY EVALUATION OF THE MODEL

```{r}
summary(stop_by_speed)

```


RESIDUAL ANALYSIS
```{r}
plot(fitted(stop_by_speed),resid(stop_by_speed))

qqnorm(resid(stop_by_speed))
qqline(resid(stop_by_speed))
```
