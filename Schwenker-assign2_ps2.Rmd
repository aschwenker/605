2. Problem set 2
Matrix factorization is a very important problem. There are supercomputers built just
to do matrix factorizations. Every second you are on an airplane, matrices are being
factorized. Radars that track flights use a technique called Kalman filtering. At the heart
of Kalman Filtering is a Matrix Factorization operation. Kalman Filters are solving linear
systems of equations when they track your flight using radars.
Write an R function to factorize a square matrix A into LU or LDU, whichever you
prefer. 
```{r}
library(matrixcalc)
LUD_3 <- function(A){
  a1<-A[1,1]
  b1<-A[2,1]
  b2<-A[2,2]
  c1<-A[3,1]
  c2<-A[3,2]
  multiplier_1<- -1*b1/a1
  multiplier_2 <- -1*c1/a1
  
  # create L based on matrix to fill in lower with multipliers
  R1<- A[1,]
  R2<-A[2,]
  R3<- A[3,]
  U<-R1
  U2<-((R1*multiplier_1)+R2)
  print(U2)
  U3_<-((R1*multiplier_2)+R3)
  U3_b2<-U2[2]
  U3_c2<-U3_[2]

  multiplier_3 <- -1*(U3_c2/U3_b2)
  print((multiplier_3))

  print(((U2*multiplier_3)))
  U3<-((U2*multiplier_3)+U3_)
  U<-rbind(U,U2,U3)
  print(U)
  L<-matrix(c(1,-1*multiplier_1,-1*multiplier_2,0,1,-1*multiplier_3,0,0,1),nrow=3,ncol=3)
  print(L)
  luA <- lu.decomposition( A )
  L2 <- luA$L
  U2 <- luA$U
  identical(U, U2)
  identical(L, L2)
}

A<-matrix(c(1,-2,3,4,8,4,-3,5,7),nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
LUD_3(A)

```


You donâ€™t have to worry about permuting rows of A and you can assume that A is less
than 5x5, if you need to hard-code any variables in your code. If you doing the entire
assignment in R, then please submit only one markdown document for both the problems.
